          Title: <u>In Her Shoes</u> (2002)<br />
          Author: Jennifer Weiner <br />
          <u>Synopsis:</u> From Jennifer Weiner comesa story of two sisters with
          nothing in common but a love for shoes learn they <br />
          are more alike than they thought possible. <br />
          <br />
          Meet Rose Feller, a thirty-year-old high powered attorney with a
          secret passion for romance novels. She has an <br />
          exercise regime she's going to start next week, and she dreams of a
          man who will slide off her glasses, gaze into her <br />
          eyes, and tell her she's beautiful. She also dreams of getting her
          fantastically screwed-up, semi-employed little <br />
          sister to straighten up and fly right. <br />
          <br />
          Meet Rose's sister, Maggie, Twenty-eight years old and drop-dead
          gorgeous. Although her big-screen stardom hasn't <br />
          progressed past her left hip's appearance in a Will Smith video,
          Maggie dreams of fame and fortune -- and of getting <br />
          her big sister on a skin-care regimen. <br />
          <br />
          These two women, who claim to have nothing in common but a childhood
          tragedy, DNA, and the same size feet, are <br />
          about to learn that they're more alike than they'd imagined. Along the
          way, they'll encounter a dicerse cast of <br />
          characters -- from a stepmother who's into recreational Botox to a
          disdainful pug with no name. They'll borrow shoes <br />
          and clothes and boyfriends, and eventually make peace with their most
          intimate enemies -- each other.
