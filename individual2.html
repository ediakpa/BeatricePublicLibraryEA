          Title: <u>The People We Hate At The Wedding</u> (2016) <br>
          Author: Grant Ginder <br>
          <u>Synopsis:</u> Paul and Alice's half-sister Eloise is getting married!  In London!
          There will be fancy hotels, dinners at "it" <br> 
          restaurants and a reception at a country estate complete with tea lights and 
          embroidered cloth napkins. <br>
          They couldn't hate it more. <br>
          <br>
          The People We Hate at the Wedding is the story of a less than perfect family.
          Donna, the clan's mother, is now a <br>
          widow living in the Chicago suburbs with a penchant for the occasional joint and
          more than one glass of wine with <br>
          her best friend while watching House Hunters International.  Alice is in her 
          thirties, single, smart, beautiful, stuck in a <br>
          dead-end job where she is mired in a rather predictable, though enjoyable, affair with 
          her married boss.  Her brother <br>
          Paul lives in Philadelphia with his older, handsomer, tenures track professor boyfriend 
          who's recently been saying <br>
          things like "monogamy is an oppressive heteronormative construct," while eyeing undergrads.  
          And then, there's <br>
          Eloise.  Perfect, gorgeous, cultured Eloise.  The product of Donna's first marriage to a dashing 
          Frenchman, Eloise has <br>
          spent her school years at the best private boarding schools, her winter holidays in St. John 
          and a post-college life <br>
          cushioned by a fat, endless trust fund.  To top it off, she's infuriatingly kind and decent. <br>
          <br>
          As this estranged clan gathers together, and Eloise's walk down the aisle approaches, Grant Ginder 
          brings to vivid, <br>
          hilarious life the power of family, and the complicated ways we hate the ones we love the most 
          in the most bitingly <br> 
          funny, slyly witty and surprisingly tender novel you'll read this year.
